This repository provides educational MATLAB scripts demonstrating basic drone dynamics and control in 1D and 2D settings. The goal is to help students and enthusiasts understand how simple models of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) motion can be simulated and controlled using PID-based strategies.

1D Case: Simulates vertical motion (altitude control) of a drone using a basic point-mass model and feedback control.

2D Case: Extends the model to planar motion, incorporating pitch dynamics and coordinated thrust control for horizontal and vertical movement.

The tutorials are designed to be modular and beginner-friendly, offering a hands-on introduction to drone control principles, simulation techniques, and visualization.
